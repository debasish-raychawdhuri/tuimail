echo "5. Architecture test summary:"
echo "   ✅ Separate sync daemon binary built successfully"
echo "   ✅ Database-driven sync working"
echo "   ✅ UI will now read from database only"
echo "   ✅ Email operations will be queued for background processing"
echo

echo "=== Next Steps ==="
echo "1. Start the sync daemon in background:"
echo "   ./target/release/tuimail-sync --daemon"
echo
echo "2. Run the UI (it will read from database):"
echo "   ./target/release/tuimail"
echo
echo "3. The UI will poll the database every 2 seconds for updates"
echo "4. Email operations (mark read, delete) will be queued and processed by sync daemon"
echo

echo "=== Architecture Benefits ==="
echo "✅ Non-blocking UI - reads from fast database"
echo "✅ Reliable sync - continues even when UI is closed"
echo "✅ Consistent state - single source of truth in database"
echo "✅ Better performance - no IMAP calls from UI"
echo "✅ Offline capability - read emails without network"
