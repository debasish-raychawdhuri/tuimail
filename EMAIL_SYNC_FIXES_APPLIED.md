# Email Synchronization Fixes Applied

## Summary
Successfully applied fixes to resolve the email synchronization issues in TUImail where only 100 emails were being synced instead of all emails in the mailbox.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Limited Initial Sync (100 emails only)
**Problem**: Initial sync was hardcoded to fetch only the most recent 100 emails
**Location**: `src/email.rs` lines 1051 and 1140
**Fix**: Changed from `std::cmp::min(100, current_total)` to `current_total`
**Result**: Now downloads ALL emails during initial sync

### 2. ✅ Enabled Full Sync Functionality  
**Problem**: `force_full_sync` function was marked as dead code
**Location**: `src/email.rs` line 841
**Fix**: Removed `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute
**Result**: Full sync function is now available for use

### 3. ✅ Added Full Sync Method to App
**Problem**: No way to trigger full sync from the UI
**Location**: `src/app.rs` lines 935-962
**Fix**: Added `force_full_sync()` method to App struct
**Result**: App can now perform full sync operations

### 4. ✅ Added Keyboard Shortcut
**Problem**: No user interface to trigger full sync
**Location**: `src/app.rs` lines 1224-1227
**Fix**: Added Shift+R keyboard shortcut
**Result**: Users can press Shift+R to force full sync

### 5. ✅ Increased Fetch Limit
**Problem**: Regular refresh only showed 50 emails
**Location**: `src/app.rs` (fetch_emails call)
**Fix**: Increased limit from 50 to 200 emails
**Result**: Better user experience with more emails visible

## Files Modified
- `src/email.rs` - Fixed initial sync limits and enabled force_full_sync
- `src/app.rs` - Added force_full_sync method and keyboard shortcut
- Backup files created: `.backup` extensions

## How to Use the Fixes

### 1. Start TUImail
```bash
cd /home/debasish/rust/email_client
./target/release/tuimail
```

### 2. Force Full Sync
- Press `Shift+R` to trigger a complete sync of all emails
- Status messages will show progress
- All emails from the server will be downloaded and cached

### 3. Regular Refresh
- Press `r` for regular refresh (now shows up to 200 emails)
- This will fetch new emails incrementally

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Only 100 most recent emails synced initially
- Database had 111 emails but interface showed 100
- No way to sync older emails
- Limited to 50 emails in interface

### After Fix:
- ALL emails from mailbox will be synced initially
- Database and interface counts will match
- Shift+R allows full re-sync anytime
- Interface shows up to 200 emails
- Proper incremental sync for new emails

## Technical Details

### Initial Sync Process:
1. Connects to IMAP server
2. Gets total message count from server
3. Downloads ALL messages (not just 100)
4. Saves all emails to local database
5. Updates metadata with correct counts

### Incremental Sync Process:
1. Checks last synced UID
2. Downloads only new emails since last sync
3. Merges with existing cached emails
4. Updates database incrementally

### Full Sync Process (Shift+R):
1. Resets sync metadata
2. Re-downloads ALL emails from server
3. Replaces local cache completely
4. Useful for fixing sync issues or missing emails

## Performance Notes
- Initial full sync may take time for large mailboxes
- Progress shown in debug logs (EMAIL_DEBUG=1)
- Subsequent syncs are fast (incremental only)
- Database efficiently stores and retrieves emails

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Check email count in interface matches server
2. Scroll through all emails to confirm they're accessible
3. Use Shift+R to force full sync and verify count
4. Check database: `sqlite3 ~/.cache/tuimail/*/emails.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emails;"`

The fix addresses the core issue where TUImail was not properly syncing all emails from the server, ensuring users can access their complete email history.
