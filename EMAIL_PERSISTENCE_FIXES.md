# Email Persistence and Address Parsing Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **"Unknown" From Addresses** ✅
**Problem**: Email addresses were showing as "Unknown" in the email list because the email parsing wasn't properly extracting from/to/cc addresses from email headers.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented robust email address parsing with `parse_email_addresses()` function
- Handles multiple email address formats:
  - `"Name" <email@domain.com>`
  - `Name <email@domain.com>`
  - `<email@domain.com>`
  - `email@domain.com`
- Properly handles quoted names and multiple addresses separated by commas
- Extracts both display names and email addresses correctly

### 2. **Email Persistence/Caching** ✅
**Problem**: Downloaded emails were not stored locally, so users could only see the most recent emails fetched from the server. Earlier emails would disappear when the app restarted.

**Solution**:
- Implemented file-based email caching system
- Cache location: `~/.cache/email_client/{account_email}/`
- Each folder has its own cache file (e.g., `INBOX.json`)
- Features:
  - **Automatic caching**: All fetched emails are saved locally
  - **Merge strategy**: New emails are merged with cached emails
  - **Offline access**: If server is unavailable, shows cached emails
  - **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate emails using email ID
  - **Sorted display**: Emails sorted by date (newest first)

## Technical Implementation

### Email Address Parsing
```rust
fn parse_email_addresses(value: &str) -> Vec<EmailAddress> {
    // Handles multiple formats and comma-separated addresses
    // Removes quotes from names
    // Extracts both name and email parts
}
```

### Email Caching System
```rust
impl EmailClient {
    fn load_cached_emails(&self, folder: &str) -> Vec<Email>
    fn save_cached_emails(&self, folder: &str, emails: &[Email])
    fn merge_emails(&self, cached: Vec<Email>, new: Vec<Email>) -> Vec<Email>
}
```

### Serialization Support
- Added `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits to email structures
- Custom DateTime serialization for `DateTime<Local>`
- Binary data handling for email attachments with `serde_bytes`

## Benefits

### 1. **Better User Experience**
- Email addresses now display properly with names when available
- Users can see their email history even after app restarts
- Faster startup when emails are cached
- Works offline with previously downloaded emails

### 2. **Performance Improvements**
- Reduced server requests for already-downloaded emails
- Faster email list loading from local cache
- Background sync keeps cache updated

### 3. **Reliability**
- Graceful fallback to cached emails if server is unavailable
- No data loss when network issues occur
- Persistent email storage across sessions

## Cache Management

### Cache Location
```
~/.cache/email_client/
├── user_at_gmail_com/
│   ├── INBOX.json
│   ├── Sent.json
│   └── Drafts.json
└── work_at_company_com/
    ├── INBOX.json
    └── Sent.json
```

### Cache Features
- **Automatic cleanup**: Old emails naturally age out as new ones are fetched
- **Account separation**: Each email account has its own cache directory
- **Folder separation**: Each folder (INBOX, Sent, etc.) has separate cache
- **JSON format**: Human-readable cache files for debugging

## Usage Impact

### Before Fix
- Email addresses showed as "Unknown"
- Only recent emails visible
- No offline access
- Email history lost on restart

### After Fix
- Proper sender names and addresses displayed
- Full email history preserved
- Works offline with cached emails
- Fast loading from local storage
- Seamless online/offline experience

The email client now provides a much more complete and reliable email experience with proper address display and persistent email storage!
