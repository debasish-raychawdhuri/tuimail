# Email Selection Fix - "Invalid Email Selection" Error

## Problem Description

After implementing the dirty flag optimization, users were getting "Invalid email selection" errors when trying to open emails. The application would display emails in the list but clicking on them would show this error instead of opening the email.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a mismatch between two different email collections in the App struct:

1. **`account_data.emails`** - The complete list of emails for an account (stored in `AccountData`)
2. **`self.emails`** - The current page of emails used by UI operations (stored directly in `App`)

### The Problem

The application uses a pagination system where:
- `account_data.emails` contains ALL emails for the account
- `self.emails` should contain only the current PAGE of emails (e.g., 50 emails per page)
- UI operations (like opening emails) use `self.emails` with page-local indices

However, in several places where `account_data.emails` was being updated, `self.emails` was not being synchronized. This caused:

```
account_data.emails: [email1, email2, ..., email1000]  // 1000 emails total
self.emails: []                                         // Empty or stale
selected_email_idx: Some(5)                            // User selected 6th email

// When trying to access self.emails[5] -> Index out of bounds!
```

## Locations Fixed

### 1. `load_emails_for_account_folder()` - Line 1173
**Before:**
```rust
account_data.emails = db_emails;
self.update_pagination();
```

**After:**
```rust
account_data.emails = db_emails;
self.update_pagination();
// Update current page emails for UI operations
self.emails = self.get_current_page_emails();
```

### 2. Empty emails case - Line 1206
**Before:**
```rust
account_data.emails = Vec::new();
```

**After:**
```rust
account_data.emails = Vec::new();
// Update current page emails for UI operations
self.emails = self.get_current_page_emails();
```

### 3. Flag changes case - Line 1574
**Before:**
```rust
account_data.emails = fresh_emails;
self.update_pagination();
```

**After:**
```rust
account_data.emails = fresh_emails;
self.update_pagination();
// Update current page emails for UI operations
self.emails = self.get_current_page_emails();
```

### 4. Account switching case - Line 3559
**Before:**
```rust
self.update_pagination();
```

**After:**
```rust
self.update_pagination();
// Update current page emails for UI operations
self.emails = self.get_current_page_emails();
```

### 5. New emails detected (dirty flag) - Line 3714
**Before:**
```rust
account_data.emails = all_emails;
self.update_pagination();
```

**After:**
```rust
account_data.emails = all_emails;
self.update_pagination();
// Update current page emails for UI operations
self.emails = self.get_current_page_emails();
```

### 6. Email count changed case - Line 3761
**Before:**
```rust
account_data.emails = db_emails;
self.update_pagination();
```

**After:**
```rust
account_data.emails = db_emails;
self.update_pagination();
// Update current page emails for UI operations
self.emails = self.get_current_page_emails();
```

## How the Fix Works

### The `get_current_page_emails()` Method

This method correctly extracts the current page of emails from the full account email list:

```rust
pub fn get_current_page_emails(&self) -> Vec<Email> {
    let all_emails = if let Some(account_data) = self.accounts.get(&self.current_account_idx) {
        &account_data.emails
    } else {
        return Vec::new();
    };
    
    let start_idx = self.current_email_page * self.emails_per_page;
    let end_idx = std::cmp::min(start_idx + self.emails_per_page, all_emails.len());
    
    if start_idx < all_emails.len() {
        all_emails[start_idx..end_idx].to_vec()
    } else {
        Vec::new()
    }
}
```

### Synchronization Pattern

Now whenever `account_data.emails` is updated, we follow this pattern:

1. **Update account data**: `account_data.emails = new_emails;`
2. **Update pagination**: `self.update_pagination();` (calculates total pages)
3. **Sync UI emails**: `self.emails = self.get_current_page_emails();` (extracts current page)

## Email Selection Logic

The UI operations work with page-local indices:

```rust
// User selects email #5 on current page
self.selected_email_idx = Some(5);

// UI tries to access the email
if let Some(idx) = self.selected_email_idx {
    if idx < self.emails.len() {  // Now this check passes!
        let email = &self.emails[idx];  // Now this works!
        // ... open email ...
    } else {
        self.show_error("Invalid email selection");  // This no longer happens
    }
}
```

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. **Build the project**: `cargo build --release`
2. **Run the application**: `./target/release/tuimail`
3. **Test email selection**:
   - Navigate through email list with arrow keys
   - Press Enter to open emails
   - Switch between accounts
   - Navigate between pages
   - Wait for new emails to arrive (dirty flag)

All these operations should now work without "Invalid email selection" errors.

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Always sync `self.emails`** after updating `account_data.emails`
2. **Use the pattern**: Update → Paginate → Sync
3. **Consider refactoring** to eliminate the dual email storage (future enhancement)

## Performance Impact

The fix has minimal performance impact:
- `get_current_page_emails()` only copies the current page (typically 50 emails)
- Called only when email data actually changes
- Much faster than the original issue of broken email selection
