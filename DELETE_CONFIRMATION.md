# Delete Confirmation Feature

## Overview
TUImail now includes a safety confirmation dialog when deleting emails to prevent accidental deletions.

## How It Works

### Before (Dangerous)
- Pressing `d` or `Delete` key would immediately delete the selected email
- No way to undo accidental deletions
- Risk of losing important emails

### After (Safe)
- Pressing `d` or `Delete` key shows a confirmation dialog
- User must explicitly confirm the deletion
- Multiple ways to cancel the operation

## User Interface

### Confirmation Dialog
When you press `d` or `Delete`, a red-bordered dialog appears with:

```
⚠️  Delete Email Confirmation

Are you sure you want to delete this email?
This action cannot be undone.

Press 'y' to confirm deletion
Press 'n' or Esc to cancel
```

### Key Bindings
- **`y` or `Y`**: Confirm deletion (email will be deleted)
- **`n` or `N`**: Cancel deletion (return to normal mode)
- **`Esc`**: Cancel deletion (return to normal mode)

### Status Bar
When in delete confirmation mode, the status bar shows:
```
Delete email? Press 'y' to confirm, 'n' or Esc to cancel
```

## Implementation Details

### New App Mode
- Added `DeleteConfirm` to the `AppMode` enum
- Separate mode handling for confirmation logic
- Background shows normal email list for context

### UI Components
- Centered dialog with red warning styling
- Clear visual indication of destructive action
- Maintains context by showing email list behind dialog

### Safety Features
- **No accidental deletions**: Requires explicit confirmation
- **Multiple cancel options**: `n`, `N`, or `Esc` to cancel
- **Clear visual warning**: Red styling and warning emoji
- **Reversible action**: Can cancel before confirming

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Accidents**: No more accidental email deletions
2. **User-Friendly**: Clear, intuitive confirmation process
3. **Flexible**: Multiple ways to confirm or cancel
4. **Visual**: Clear warning with appropriate styling
5. **Consistent**: Works with both `d` key and `Delete` key

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Same key bindings trigger delete (now with confirmation)
- No breaking changes to user workflow
- Only adds safety layer, doesn't remove features

## Testing
The feature has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Confirmation dialog appears correctly
- ✅ `y` key confirms and deletes email
- ✅ `n` key cancels and returns to normal mode
- ✅ `Esc` key cancels and returns to normal mode
- ✅ Dialog styling and layout work properly
- ✅ Background email list remains visible
- ✅ Status bar updates appropriately

This safety improvement makes TUImail more reliable for daily email management by preventing costly mistakes.
